**MOA Hotel Reservation System**
**Project Overview**

The MOA Hotel Reservation System is a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate seamless hotel bookings across several countries. Integrating with an API for every reservation made through our website, the system ensures a personalized and dynamic user experience by capturing essential details such as user information, accompanying guests, dates, and more.

**Features**:

- Dynamic Email Confirmation: Upon reservation, the system automatically generates a detailed confirmation email in the user's language and currency. This email includes a link to confirm the reservation and allows for data modification if necessary.
- Intelligent Reminder System: As the date of stay approaches, the system triggers reminders with tailored messages to finalize any outstanding details, enhancing the customer service experience.
- Salesforce CRM Integration: Tasks are automatically created in Salesforce CRM for actions such as following up on unconfirmed reservations or addressing email bounces.
- Multi-language and Currency Support: Catering to a global clientele, the system adapts to different languages and currencies, with the capability to convert values to euros or local currency.
- Automated Marketing Tracking: The system provides an automated tracking of email opens and clicks for the marketing team through Salesforce Marketing Cloud.

**Operational Workflow**
- Reservations and confirmations are systematically tracked and managed through a combination of automated emails and Salesforce CRM tasks.
- Regular data exports to Salesforce Marketing Cloud at specified intervals ensure timely and accurate marketing analytics.
